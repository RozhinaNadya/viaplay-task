Work Sample - Presenting data from Viaplay's Content API
 
# TASK:

We use an API with a dynamic structure. Here is the API endpoint for iOS devices:
https://content.viaplay.com/ios-se

Use the array of sections returned by the API in viaplay:sections to create a simple app that presents
these sections to the user.

See this work as a first step in a bigger project which would handle more features and more developers.


*Requirements:*

- The user should be able to see the title of each section

- The app should work online and offline (after first request to the API)


*Points to consider:*

- The API contains a lot of data! We are only interested in the section titles.

- The section links can be found in the links array in the API response
